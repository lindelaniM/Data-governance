# Data-governance

# CHAPTER 1: DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE

What is data governance: proactively managing your data inorder to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives. This is done by improving the quality of your data(Data governance: is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.

Inorder to be sucessful your framework needs the following 3 things:
# Policy: to mandate how your organization is going to manage data
# roles and responsibility :concernig data
# processes: detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

WHAT IS MENT BY DATA GOVERNANCE?
Governance is a manner in which entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. 

Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.

laws
The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent. For example, given their goals as organizations, governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise. Each of these entities has different purposes and responsibilities.

Importance
Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
*Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

# Data Governance Versus Data Management
Data governance: sets the rules for how data is handled within an organization. This includes things like who is responsible for different data sets, what policies are in place to ensure data quality, and how data is measured and tracked throughout its lifecycle.
Data management: is the practical side of things. It's about using technology and tools to implement the data governance rules. This includes things like building databases and data warehouses, securing data with encryption, and analyzing data to make informed decisions.
Data Governance versus Information Governance
Data governance: deals with the data itself, regardless of its specific meaning. It focuses on policies and procedures to ensure things like data security, for instance, for patient or staff data. Here, the emphasis is on protecting the data, not its specific use in the business.

Information governance: on the other hand, is all about the meaning and context of data. It looks at how data relates to each other and how it can be used to generate value for the organization, customers, and stakeholders.

The Value of Data Governance
Data is seen as critical for success by many businesses. (statistic cited)

Organizations that implement processes to manage data effectively show a commitment to data governance. This involves controlling and being accountable for how data is used.

# SOME OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGES ACHIEVED BY GOOD DATA GOVERNANCE:
Improved data quality
Expanded data value
Increased data compliance
Improved data-driven decision-making
Enhanced business performance
Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
Increased data availability and accessibility
Improved data search
Reduced risks from data-related issues
Reduced data management costs
Established rules for handling data
CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization. It’s safe to say that for a growing number of organizations, data governance is becoming a very big deal.

THE MOST COMMON ELEMENTS OF DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM:

Developing a Data Governance Framework
A data governance framework is essentially a blueprint for how an organization manages its data. It's a set of rules, processes, and responsibilities that dictate how data is collected, stored, used, and protected. The goal is :

High quality: Accurate, consistent, and reliable.
Secure: Protected from unauthorized access or breaches.
Compliant: Follows all relevant laws and regulations.
Accessible: Available to those who need it for legitimate purposes.
COMMON COMPONENTS OF A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
image

- Roles and responsibilities: Who is accountable for different aspects of data governance? (e.g., data stewards, data quality specialists)

- Policies: Guidelines for how data should be handled (e.g., data security policies, data retention policies)

- Standards: Definitions and formats for data to ensure consistency (e.g., data dictionaries)

- Metrics: How will you measure the success of your data governance program? (e.g., data quality metrics)

- Processes: Specific procedures for handling data throughout its lifecycle (e.g., data cleansing procedures)

#Tools: There's a wide range of software to support data governance and management tasks. These tools address various needs such as managing master data, creating data catalogs, data searching, data security, data integration, data analysis, and ensuring compliance with regulations. Recently, data science tools have become easier to use and more automated, making data management less complex. This improvement allows more people to participate in effectively managing data and extracting value from it.

#Communications and Collaboration; Data governance involves ongoing changes, so keeping everyone informed is crucial. This communication can happen through various channels like meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Special attention needs to be paid to explaining how these changes impact different teams and their responsibilities within the data governance program.

PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
Just setting up a team, plan, and buying tools isn't enough for successful data governance.

Organizations need to assess if they're prepared for the cultural shift it entails.

A key factor is having a data culture - how data is viewed and handled within the organization.

A mature, data-driven culture is much more receptive to data governance than a reactive one where data handling is haphazard.

Another crucial element for success is ensuring the organization's overall strategy aligns with the data governance program. Misalignment is a major reason for program failures.

# WHAT IS DATA CULTURE?

Impact on Success: A strong data culture is a critical factor for successful data governance implementation. If employees don't understand the importance of data quality, security, and responsible use, data governance initiatives will likely face resistance and struggle to achieve their goals.
Characteristics of a Good Data Culture:
A data-driven culture is characterized by:

- Data awareness: People recognize the value of data and its potential to improve decision-making.

- Data literacy: Employees have the skills and knowledge to understand, work with, and analyze data effectively.

- Data sharing: There's an openness to sharing data across departments to achieve organizational goals.

- Data accountability: People are held responsible for the quality and responsible use of data they handle.

Data Governance Fosters a Data Culture: While a strong data culture is essential for successful data governance, the process itself can also help cultivate those positive attitudes and behaviors. By setting clear policies, promoting data literacy programs, and demonstrating the value of data-driven decision making, data governance initiatives can influence how people view and interact with data throughout the organization.

Assessing the Data Culture
Maturing the Data Culture:
Leadership champions data: Leaders need to actively communicate the importance of data and demonstrate its value through real-world examples of successful data-driven decisions.

Empowering employees: Provide basic data skills training covering data manipulation, analysis, cleansing, querying, and visualization. Don't underestimate the power of common tools like spreadsheets for data management.

Start small, celebrate progress: Focus on achievable steps to initiate the data culture journey. Basic data management skills training can be a good starting point. Celebrate even small wins to keep momentum going.

Embrace challenges: Acknowledge that there will be resistance and frustration during this culture shift. Focus on providing support mechanisms like open communication channels and positive discussions to address concerns and celebrate successes.

Assessing Data Governance Readiness
Unfortunately, the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low. It’s important to maximize the conditions for success. You may not get a second chance.

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

## CHAPTER 2

Traditionally, organizations operate with limitations (budget, time, etc.). This scarcity is a fundamental principle in economics.

However, the situation with data is quite different. Most organizations today have vast amounts of data collected through their activities, products, services, and interactions with customers and partners. This abundance of data, rather than limitations, presents a new challenge.

Organizations are now faced with questions about harnessing the potential of this data, protecting it, and simply managing its sheer volume.

We're living in the age of big data, and effectively managing this data can significantly improve an organization's performance and profitability.

# Defining Data
Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts.

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

- Structured:
Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.

- Unstructured:
Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.

- Semi-structured:
Data that contains additional information to enable the native form

# From Data to Insight
Simply collecting and storing data isn't valuable. It needs to be done with a specific purpose or intended future use in mind.

There might be some rare exceptions where collecting data without an immediate use case makes sense, but this shouldn't be the norm.

In most cases, organizations collect data because it's essential for a particular goal or function.

# The Differences Between Data and Information

Data is the raw, unprocessed information we collect.
Information is data put into context, making it more meaningful.
Knowledge is what you can do with information. It's actionable and allows you to understand how to use information for a specific purpose. This is where the saying "knowledge is power" comes into play.
Wisdom builds upon knowledge. It involves applying reasoning, values, and broader life experiences to make sound judgments about the validity and application of knowledge in different situations. Not all knowledge is wisdom, but all wisdom includes knowledge.
Insight is the deepest level of understanding. It combines knowledge and wisdom to see something in a new light and gain a deeper understanding. It allows you to think or see things differently.

Different organizations can have varying results even when analyzing the same data set.
There's no guaranteed path to the "best" outcome, regardless of the tools, processes, or skills used.
However, good data governance practices can significantly improve the results you get from your data.
The Role of Data in the 21st Century
Data's Consistent Value: Data has always played a crucial role in helping us understand the world, make better decisions, and solve problems.

The Data Explosion: Since the mid-20th century, the rise of computers significantly increased the volume, quality, and accessibility of data.

The Information Age: The internet's arrival in the mid-90s made information readily available, fulfilling the vision of "information at your fingertips."

Democratization of Information: Bill Gates' vision of accessible information for everyone further emphasized the growing importance of data in the late 1980s.

Data Deluge: We're producing more data than we can manage. This vast data, with its depth, breadth, and quality, is transforming various aspects of our lives.

Impact on Industries and Cities: This data revolutionizes the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities.
Societal Shifts: It's fundamentally changing how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
Heightened Risks: Cybersecurity threats are no longer minor inconveniences. A cyberattack can now cause significant financial losses within a short time frame.
Data-Driven Decision-Making
Data for Personal Choices: We use data in everyday decisions, like reading online reviews to choose a restaurant. This data is valuable to both consumers (informing decisions) and businesses (gaining customer feedback).

Data for Complex Decisions: Businesses use vast amounts of data to make complex choices, like entering new markets. Analyzing this data helps make well-informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

Data Makes a Difference: Access to good data and the ability to analyze it are crucial for making sound decisions. Without this, businesses risk making poor choices.

IMPORTANT * Good Data Makes Good Decisions: Having a lot of data is helpful, but it needs to be accurate and reliable (good quality) to make sound decisions.

Quality Over Quantity: Bad data can lead to poor choices and challenges. 21st Century Data Abundance: We have a lot of data available now, but ensuring its quality requires specific actions.

Data Governance for Quality: Data governance practices are essential for achieving good quality data.

Data as The New Oil
Data as the New Oil: This quote by Clive Humby emphasizes that data, like oil, is a valuable resource that fuels modern economies.

Data Needs Processing: Just as oil needs refining to be useful, data requires processing and analysis to unlock its true potential.

Extracting Value from Data: This processing involves organizing and analyzing data to identify patterns, make informed decisions, solve problems, and feed other systems.

Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
the below passage compares data to oil and highlights its importance in the digital age:

Data Fuels Digital Economies: Similar to how oil powered industrial economies, data is the driving force behind the digital economies of the 21st century.

Tech Giants Lead the Way: Companies like Facebook and Google, with their vast data resources, are major players in this data-driven economy.

Data Revolution Across Industries: Data and digitalization are transforming every sector, from banking and government to countless others.

Data as a Profit Engine: Organizations are shifting data management from a cost to a profit center, using data to power their businesses and generate revenue streams.

Power Imbalance and Risks: Just like oil, control of large amounts of valuable data grants immense power. The historical dependence on oil highlights potential risks associated with a few big players managing personal data.

Data Ownership
Effective management requires assigning clear responsibility. This is done through job descriptions and project roles.

Similarly, data accountability is crucial. Every data set within an organization needs to have someone responsible for it.

This concept shouldn't be surprising, as it aligns with established management practices.

The passage defines data ownership and the varying levels of control it entails:
Data Ownership refers to the rights and control exercised over a particular data set by ana individual, team, or organization.
Spectrum of Control: This control can range from basic oversight to strict, legally binding rules.
Example: Intellectual Property: Data related to intellectual property (copyrights, trade secrets) will typically have strong ownership protections, including restrictions on access, usage, and purpose.
DATA ARCHITECTURE
Technology is Essential: Nearly every organization relies on technology to operate and deliver products or services. They can be considered technology businesses in this sense.

Enterprise Architecture (EA): This framework helps organizations design, plan, and implement the right technology solutions (systems, policies, projects) aligned with their overall business strategy. It uses established standards and principles.

Data Architecture as a Subset of EA: Just like EA focuses on the bigger picture of technology aligning with strategy, data architecture focuses specifically on how data is designed and managed to support both EA and the overall business goals.

Data Architecture Blueprint: In simpler terms, data architecture is the agreed-upon plan for how data structures and management practices will support the organization's functions and technologies.

IMPORTANT * Strong Architectures, Smooth Operations: When both EA and data architecture are implemented effectively, organizations can function more efficiently and adapt to changing circumstances (internal or external).

The Downside of Weak Architectures: Poor or missing architectures can hinder digital transformation efforts, introduce complexity, and increase the risk of failure.

Working Together: By design, these architectures work together to ensure data supports the organization's technological needs and overall business strategy.

fIVE KEY OBJECTIVES OF DATA ARCHITECTURE
Data Accessibility: Ensuring the right people have access to the data they need to do their jobs, while also controlling access for security purposes.

Data Usability: Simplifying how people can find, understand, and use data within the organization.

Data Protection: Implementing safeguards to protect data in accordance with organizational policies and legal requirements.

Data Standardization: Establishing consistent data formats and definitions to ensure clear and consistent data use across the organization.

5.Data Efficiency: Optimizing data flows to eliminate redundancy, bottlenecks, and wasted resources.

The passage highlights the connection between data governance and data architecture:
Data Architecture Reflects Governance: A well-defined and functioning data architecture indicates an organization prioritizes data. It's managed as a valuable asset with controls to ensure alignment with business needs.

Shared Responsibility: Similar to enterprise architecture, data architecture isn't solely a technical concern. It's a responsibility shared across the organization.

Data Flow and Silos: In medium to large organizations, data needs to seamlessly flow across departments (e.g., sales and product development) and serve diverse users in various formats. Data architecture helps achieve this.

THE LIFE CYCLE OF DATA
All data goes through phases during its lifecycle image

FIVE STAGES OF THE DATA LIFECYCLE:

Creation: This is the origin of data. It can be generated manually or automatically, internally or externally, through various activities and system interactions.

Storage: Once created and intended for future use, data needs to be stored. This often involves databases residing on local drives, servers, or cloud storage solutions.

Usage: Data is typically collected and stored for a reason - to be used later, possibly for analysis. Before use, data may require processing to cleanse errors, convert formats, or manage access permissions.

Archiving: Here, data identified as inactive gets moved to a long-term storage system outside the active environment. This archived data can still be retrieved and used if needed in the future.

Destruction: While some might prefer to hold onto everything indefinitely, there comes a point when data destruction is necessary. This could be due to regulations, policies, or simply no longer needing the data. Destruction ensures data becomes inaccessible and unreadable, sometimes involving physical destruction of storage devices.

IMPORTANCE!
Data Lifecycle Stages: Data exists in various states throughout its lifecycle (creation, storage, usage, archival, destruction).

Stage-Specific Treatment: Data requirements and handling differ depending on the lifecycle stage. For instance, security measures for actively used data will be stricter compared to archived data.

Data Governance Impact: Understanding the data lifecycle is crucial for data governance as it helps determine appropriate handling practices at each stage.

UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF BIG DATA
Data collection has been around for a long time, even before computers. People have been keeping records for thousands of years, like the Romans using ledgers.

The 20th century saw advancements in data storage due to the Cold War.

The space race, a part of the Cold War, further accelerated innovation in computing and communication.

The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution
The massive task of processing census data in the 1880s (taking 8 years!) led to the invention of data processing machines.

The Tabulating Machine Company (later IBM) created a system using punch cards to represent and process census information.

This innovation in data processing laid the foundation for future advancements and the rise of the Information Age.

The success of data processing for the census led to its use in other areas, further accelerating the information revolution.

Defining Big Data(THE FIVE VS THAT DEFINE BIG DATA)
Volume: The massive amount of data being generated requires new approaches to handle it.

Variety: The ever-increasing number of data formats demands new methods for handling, analyzing, and securing this data.

Velocity: Data is constantly being created and transferred at ever-growing speeds.

Variability: The unpredictable nature of data creation and flow makes it challenging to manage.

Veracity: The accuracy and quality of vast amounts of data can vary significantly, posing a problem for data management.

Drivers of Big Data
Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, in 2003. He claimed that the amount of data created globally every two days surpassed the total data created throughout human history up to that point. This emphasizes the explosive growth of data generation in the early 21st century.

THE EXISTANCE OF BIG DATA
The explosion of smartphones and apps
The Internet of Things (IoT) with its billions of connected devices
The massive amounts of social media content like cat videos
In a nutshell, big data grew explosively in the third decade of the 21st century, reaching zettabytes in size.

EXAMPLE OF A DAIGRAM SHOWING DATA GROWTH IN ZETTABYTES FROM 2010 TO 2025
image

In 2021, 79 zettabytes of data were created globally.

This amount is expected to reach 180 zettabytes by 2025.

The point is that future readers (e.g., in 2040) might find these numbers insignificant, similar to how 32GB phone storage seemed massive in 2015 but feels small today.

This emphasizes the exponential growth of data generation.

CONSEQUENCES OF BIG DATA
IMPORTANT
Big data statistics might seem impressive, but there's more to the story.
Key challenges exist with big data quality, accessibility, and analysis.
Up to 80% of data is unstructured, making it difficult to handle for most organizations.
Data can also be duplicated or bad (containing errors), posing further challenges.
Despite the challenges mentioned earlier, big data offers significant benefits:

It provides valuable insights for organizations of all kinds.
It fuels innovation across various fields, from self-driving cars to efficient supply chains.
WHAT IS SMALL DATA?
All this talk about big data might suggest that small amounts of data just aren’t as interesting or valuable. I don’t want to suggest that, as it would be wrong.

IMPORTANT
Big data dominates decision-making in the digital economy, but small data sets also play a crucial role.
Examples include spreadsheets, short surveys, and personal to-do lists.
While less glamorous than big data, small data can be equally valuable in specific situations.
BIG DATA CAN BE ANSWERED IN SMALL DATA
Big questions can be answered by analyzing smaller datasets.
Big data often needs to be broken down into smaller chunks for better comprehension.
In some cases, using smaller, well-organized datasets might be the only way to make sense of massive amounts of data.
ENTER THE REALM OF SMART DATA
Big data can be overwhelming due to its vast volume, variety, and speed (velocity).

Smart data tackles this by applying processes to big data, making it more usable for specific purposes.

This allows for targeted marketing campaigns or real-time analytics in manufacturing, for instance.

Smart data leverages new tools like AI to identify patterns and extract relevant data from unstructured big data sets.

AI helps reduce processing time, errors, and enables creation of more focused data subsets.

Additionally, smart data solutions are often implemented at the data collection stage, rather than as an afterthought.

DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
CHAPTER FOCUS

Identifying many roles data plays in organizations
Delivering insight from data
Recognizing that data is an asset
Exploring four approaches to data analytics
IDENTIFYING THE ROLES OF DATA

Data's value extends beyond specific departments like data analytics or IT.
It's used extensively in various daily business functions, highlighting its overall significance.
For data to be truly valuable, it needs to be:
High-quality (accurate and reliable)
Secure (protected from unauthorized access)
Compliant with regulations
Accessible to authorized personnel when needed
The passage argues that data isn't just relevant to specialists, leaders, or specific departments, but holds importance across the entire organization.
OPERATIONS
Businesses have various day-to-day activities to fulfill their goals.
These activities, called operational functions, differ based on the specific needs of each business.
Some core functions, like payroll or marketing, are common across most organizations.
On the other hand, some support functions, like IT or warehousing, might not be essential for every business. For instance, a service business might not need a warehouse.
Operations rely on data: Businesses use various data and information sources to run their day-to-day activities. Operations generate data: Business activities also create new data as a byproduct.

Data drives decision-making: Businesses use data to measure performance, like HR tracking open positions and filling times. This data helps make informed decisions.

Operations generate data: HR activities themselves create data, such as candidate applications, evaluations, and system logs. This cycle applies to other operational functions as well.

Data usage within operations: Businesses use data for various purposes:

Running systems (e.g., automatic inventory reordering)
Making decisions (e.g., sales teams reporting to leadership)
Sharing information internally and externally
Automation in data management: Many data-related tasks within operations are automated. For instance, systems can send notifications based on triggers (e.g., reminder emails about unsubmitted reports).
In summary, data is a crucial element in business operations. It's used to analyze performance, make decisions, run systems, and share information. Operations also generate a significant amount of data through their daily activities.

STRATEGY
Strategy sets the direction: Every organization has a strategy, even if informal. It's a roadmap to achieve goals and overcome challenges. This can apply to the entire organization or individual departments.

Operations put it into action: Operations are the day-to-day activities that execute the strategy and make it a reality.

Data fuels success: A winning combination involves a data-driven strategy (informed by data) delivered through efficient operations.

Developing a strategy: This typically involves:

Analyzing the business environment (internal and external factors)
Drawing conclusions based on the analysis
Creating a plan guided by principles (work nature, founder values, etc.)
In essence, strategy is the "what" and "why" while operations are the "how." Both are crucial for organizational success, and data plays a vital role in making informed decisions throughout the process.
IMPORTANT
Data and experience go hand-in-hand: While data is crucial, successful strategy development considers both data and the experience-based perspectives of people involved. An over-reliance on one or the other can be detrimental.
Strategy as an ongoing process: A best practice is to revisit and potentially adjust the strategy periodically (e.g., every 6 months). This can be driven by new data (knowledge and insights) that emerges.
Adapting to changing environments: In today's fast-paced world, organizations need to respond quickly to changing conditions. Data should be the foundation of this response system, allowing for adjustments as needed.
In short, strategy development should be a data-driven process that also incorporates valuable human experience. It's an ongoing process that can be adapted based on new information and a changing environment.

DECISION- MAKING
Data's highest value lies in enabling better decision-making.
The sheer volume and quality of data available today surpass anything ever seen before.
Consumers: Search engines empower people (e.g., patients) to be more informed about their situations. This can be helpful (fewer unnecessary doctor visits) but also lead to problems if the information is inaccurate (headaches for doctors dealing with misinformation).

Businesses: Organizations benefit from readily available data. This allows for faster, more timely decisions based on real-time insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Previously, businesses might have had to wait for quarterly reports, but now they can get a clearer picture even with interim data, which is still better than having no information at all.

Quality over quantity: Having a lot of data isn't enough. It needs to be accurate and up-to-date to be valuable.

Bad data is harmful: In fact, bad data can be worse than no data at all. Using bad data to make decisions can lead to negative consequences, ranging from minor mistakes to business closure.
Success relies on good data: For data-driven decision-making to be successful, decision-makers need access to high-quality data at the right time.
MEASURING
Businesses constantly measure: Organizations, intentionally or unintentionally, are always gathering data through various measurements.
Measurement leads to better management: The saying "what gets measured gets managed" holds true. By measuring aspects of the business, leaders gain insights to improve management.
Not everything is measurable: While measurement is important, some things are inherently difficult to quantify.
Data drives informed decisions: Ultimately, leaders rely on information derived from this measurement data to make informed choices.
In essence, measurement is a crucial tool for businesses to track performance, gain insights, and make better decisions. Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language

Data (Quantitative): Focuses on measurable aspects. Here, data describes the flight's altitude (50,000 meters) and speed (750 km/h).
Information (Qualitative): Provides descriptive details. In this case, information describes a smooth flight and good meals.
Both data and information contribute to understanding the journey, although the value might depend on the audience.

In short, data is the raw numbers, while information adds context and meaning to that data.

Measurement drives information: The kind of information needed determines how you measure data. This includes what data is captured, when, where, and how.

Focus on what matters: Only collect and measure data that has a clear purpose. While some argue for collecting data "just in case" of future needs, it's crucial to be mindful of resource limitations and potential costs associated with storing unused data.

In essence, target your data collection on what's essential to get the information you need, avoiding unnecessary data gathering

The quote's message: Not everything measurable is truly important, and some crucial things might not be easily quantifiable. Data enthusiasm vs. relevance: Just because you can collect data doesn't mean it's always valuable. Focus on gathering data that has a clear purpose and provides meaningful insights. In other words, don't get carried away by the possibility of collecting data. Prioritize collecting data that truly matters and contributes valuable information.

MONITORING

Definition: Monitoring is the continuous process of collecting and assessing the performance of something, like a project, system, or process.
Comparison and Targets: The collected data is often compared to existing standards or desired goals. For instance, a factory machine might be expected to produce a certain number of units per hour (e.g., 100 widgets). Monitoring helps track if this expectation is being met.
Benefits: Monitoring serves various purposes across different activities:
Identifying performance issues (meeting expectations)
Ensuring continuity (things keep functioning as intended)
Maintaining stability (avoiding unexpected changes)
Guaranteeing reliability (performing consistently as expected) In short, monitoring is a continuous evaluation process that helps ensure things are functioning as planned and meeting established goals.
Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.

Data from Monitoring Drives Insights and Actions
Monitoring collects data on various aspects (e.g., smartphone battery life, employee activity, production line health).
This data is used for:
Reports (providing summaries)
Real-time systems (offering up-to-date information)
Dashboards (visualizing key metrics)
Monitoring helps convert data into actionable insights to guide decision-making.
Data: The Binding Tissue of Measurement and Monitoring
Measurement and monitoring are closely linked. You can only monitor what you measure.
Data acts as a connective tissue, tying different business functions together.
This interdependence requires careful oversight and controls due to:
Different teams responsible for measurement, monitoring, reporting, and taking action.
Stakeholders with varying permissions.
Monitoring Data Quality
Data monitoring goes beyond just tracking performance. It also ensures data quality for its intended purpose.
This requires:
Processes to manage data quality
Technologies to support data monitoring
Benchmarks to define quality expectations
Data quality monitoring involves setting metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy) and continuously measuring results.
Overall, data monitoring plays a crucial role in collecting valuable data, transforming it into insights, and ensuring data quality for informed decision-making. It highlights the interconnectedness of various business functions through data.

By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

INSIGHT MANAGEMENT
Data: The Fuel for Business Insights
Data is the foundation for many business functions, especially decision-making.
Business insights are essentially valuable information derived from data analysis.
Beyond Data Collection: The Need for Insight Management
Simply gathering data isn't enough. It needs proper management to generate insights.
Insight management ensures data is utilized effectively to produce valuable insights.
The Insight Management Process
Data Gathering and Analysis:
Data is collected from various sources based on a deep understanding of the organization's information needs and data value.
Analysts must also be aware of information flow within the organization and who needs access to it.
Data Analytics:
The collected data is interpreted to uncover its meaning and implications.
Communication of Findings:
Insights are communicated effectively, considering different audiences and their needs.
Communication methods can vary (e.g., executive summaries for some, detailed reports for others).
Measuring Success: Actionable Insights
Effective insight communication empowers recipients to make decisions aligned with organizational goals.
In essence, insight management is a process that transforms raw data into actionable insights through careful data gathering, analysis, and communication, ultimately driving better decision-making within an organization.

REPORTING
Reports: A Core Business Function: Creating, using, and acting on reports are fundamental activities in any organization. Some consider them the backbone of every business, emphasizing their significance.

Structured Communication: Reports present data and information in a structured format, ranging from summaries to detailed breakdowns. The content depends on the audience and purpose (e.g., expenditure report listing departmental costs).

Visuals for Clarity: Including visuals like charts is common. Charts act as a form of data storytelling, making information easier to understand, especially in today's complex business environment. Data storytelling is becoming a crucial business skill.

*Report Structure: Reports often include findings, a summary, and sometimes recommendations.

In essence, reports are a structured way to communicate data and information, aiding comprehension and driving action based on the insights they provide.

Reports: Communicating Data and Information for Action
Reports are presentations of data and information about various aspects of an organization, either online or physical (written documents).
Examples include sales reports or presentations on company plans.
Reports can be delivered in various formats (written, verbal, video), with the focus being on achieving their objective.
The target audience and purpose of the report determine its content and format.
The Power of Reports: Enabling Informed Decisions
A major purpose of reporting is to improve decision-making.
By providing the right information, in the right format, and at the right time, reports empower leaders to:
Make better decisions
Solve problems more effectively
Communicate plans and policies clearly
Beyond Information: The Importance of Action
While reports offer valuable information, they don't guarantee good decision-making.

Having knowledge is not the same as making the right choices at the right time.

In short, reports are a crucial communication tool in organizations. They present data and information in a way that is tailored to a specific audience and purpose, ultimately aiming to empower leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and take action.

OTHER ROLES FOR DATA
Artificial intelligence (AI): AI relies on a lot of good data to function well. This data helps AI find patterns, connections, and probabilities. Interestingly, AI is also being used to improve the quality and usefulness of data itself.

Problem-solving: Data is crucial throughout the problem-solving process. It helps define the problem itself, identify potential solutions, pick the best option, and assess the outcome.

Data reuse: Data can be a goldmine beyond its initial use. Once collected, data can be reused for different purposes by authorized teams within an organization. This avoids redundant data collection and maximizes its value. However, data governance is crucial to ensure such reuse complies with regulations and privacy.

IMPROVING OUTCOMES WITH DATA
treating data as a valuable asset is key to maximizing its worth. Many overlook this, but viewing data as an asset can lead to better data management practices.

IMPORTANT
Data exploration, also known as data analytics, is a core function in organizations that requires skilled professionals and specific tools. The rise of big data has made this process more intricate and demanding of expertise, but it has also heightened the value and significance of data for businesses.

APROACHING DATA AS AN ASSET
WHAT IS AN ASSET?
An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.

Assets can be either tangible (physical objects you can touch) or intangible (ideas or rights with economic value). Data, like software and brands, is an intangible asset.

Both tangible and intangible assets are important to organizations because they are recorded financially. This financial picture reflects the organization's health, and is crucial for tasks like determining taxes and securing loans.

EXAMPLES OF ECONOMIC VALUE OF DATA:
Improves operations.
Increases existing revenue.
Produces new forms of revenue.
Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
Improves the quality of products and services.
Contributes to competitive advantage.
Enables innovation.
Reduces risk.
Data, though an intangible asset valuable to organizations, isn't always reflected on their financial statements. Accounting standards vary by country, making it a complex issue for another discussion. However, this lack of formal recognition often leads to data being undervalued, underutilized, and inadequately protected.

Recognizing that data is an asset is the first step to good data governance.
Recognizing data as an asset brings a new perspective to data management. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what data you have, its quality, and its role in the organization's success. Just like financial assets, good data management requires clear ownership, accountability, and avoiding data silos. If data seems valueless, re-evaluate the need to manage it at all.

IMPORTANT
Bottom line: Data is an asset and for its value to be leveraged, it must be governed. This may be one of the most important motivations for good data governance.

DATA ANALYTICS
Raw data is cryptic and requires analysis to be useful. This process, called data analytics, involves specific tools and techniques to extract meaning and inform sound decision-making. Data analysts play a crucial role in transforming raw data into valuable insights

BASIC STEPS IN DATA ANALYSIS

FOUR PRIMARY TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS
NDescriptive: This type analyzes past data to understand what happened, often focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and business objectives.

Diagnostic: Here, the analysis digs deeper into the "why" behind past events, using descriptive analysis as a foundation.

Predictive: This analysis leverages historical data and trends to forecast future possibilities.

Prescriptive: This analysis builds on predictive techniques, but goes a step further by recommending specific actions based on predicted outcomes.

THE RELATIVE COMPLEXITY AND BUSINESS VALUE OF FOUR TYPES OF ANALYTICS
image

Data analysts use various software tools to analyze data. These tools go beyond basic spreadsheets and include options like R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and QlikView. The specific software used depends on the complexity of the data, the analyst's skills, and the desired outcome of the analysis.

IMPORTANT
Data analysis skills are becoming increasingly crucial for businesses. While large organizations might have dedicated data analysts, even basic data skills are becoming essential for most staff. In today's data-driven world, data literacy might be as vital as fundamental computer skills like using email or word processing software.

DATA MANAGEMENT

IMPORTANT
Data management is not the same as data governance! But they work closely together to deliver results in the use of enterprise data.

DEFINE DATA MANAGEMENT
Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.(Just collecting and storing data isn't enough. Data management needs to be well-developed to avoid problems like data silos, security breaches, and unreliable data)

Who would choose to make decisions based on bad data?
Good data management leads to better business outcomes. When data is treated as a valuable asset and managed effectively, several benefits arise:

Richer and timelier insights: Data analysis becomes more accurate and helps identify trends and opportunities faster.
Smoother operations: Data-driven decision-making improves efficiency and reduces errors.
Informed teams: Employees have the information they need to make better choices.
Reduced risks: Strong data management minimizes security breaches and compliance issues.
Data management is a comprehensive process:
It covers the entire data lifecycle, from collection and storage to analysis and archiving.
It ensures data flows smoothly across the organization and is accessible to authorized users.
It involves tasks like data standardization, encryption, and setting data governance policies.
Everyone plays a part:
While the technology team has a significant role in implementing data management practices, all business users are responsible for following data policies and maximizing data's value.

In summary, good data management provides the opportunity for significantly enhanced organizational performance.
GOVERNING DATA
Data governance is about establishing control to enforce related policies. Imagine a policy requiring daily data backups to minimize risk. Data governance would involve documenting the backup process and ensuring it's followed. If backups aren't happening, it would be a sign that data governance isn't functioning effectively.

IMPORTANT
To fully realize the potential of data in your organization means that data must be governed. Any time an organizational resource or asset is left unmanaged, it’s either a recipe for disaster or a missed opportunity. Even a small amount of governance beats no governance every single day.

ESSENTAIL FACRORS OFTHAT CAN REDUCE THE SUCCESS OF GOVERNNG DATA
People:
Even though machines are creating and using more data, humans remain central to data governance.
People define, design, and maintain how data is used.
They act as subject matter experts, ensure data quality, and oversee data governance processes.
Policies:
Data policies are a set of rules for handling data under specific circumstances and for desired outcomes.
These policies cover areas like data quality, privacy, security, and how long data is retained.
The number of policies depends on factors like organization size, industry, and how important data is considered.
Industries like healthcare and finance, which handle sensitive data, typically have many data governance policies.
Metrics:
Data governance effectiveness is measured through metrics that track how well policies are followed.

For example, a policy might aim for less than five data security incidents per month.

If the number of incidents doesn't decrease over time, it indicates a problem with data management practices.

Metrics should address both technical aspects (e.g., data security) and business needs (e.g., timely data for decision-making).
TRANSFORMING THROUGH DATA
CHAPTER FOCUS
Understanding the purpose of a data catalog
Exploring data monetization
Implementing data-driven decision-making
Creating a data strategy

It discusses the challenges of searching for data and how data catalogs can help users understand what data exists, where it's located, and how to access it. A good data catalog is essential for maximizing the value of data.

The chapter then introduces data monetization, which refers to the process of deriving economic benefits from data. It explores how to determine the value of data.

EXAMINING THE BOARDER VALUE OF DATA
In small businesses, data is often manageable. There are few data systems, and team members know where most data resides, like customer information or invoices. This allows for easy data access by team members without needing specialists, which is called data democratization.

IMPORTANT
As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise. Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive.

THE CHALLENGES OF DATA SILOS AND THE IMPORTANACE OF DATA DISCOVERABILITY
Data Silos: Over time, data gets compartmentalized into isolated repositories called data silos. This happens due to various factors like culture, strategy, or mergers.
Impact of Silos: Data silos cause problems:

Reduced efficiency: Collaboration is hindered as different teams don't have access to each other's data.
Increased inconsistencies: Data inconsistencies arise when the same information is stored differently in silos.
Security and regulatory risks: Siloed data management makes it harder to secure data and comply with regulations.
Data Governance and Discovery: Data governance helps break down silos by making data discoverable and accessible throughout the organization. Data catalogs are a key tool for data governance in achieving this.

The Data Search Struggle: Unlike a web search engine, finding data within an organization is often difficult.
Finding relevant data can take up 70% of an analyst's time, leaving only 30% for actual analysis (according to an IBM survey).
Ironically, it can be easier to find information about your own company through a public search engine than through internal systems.
The passage highlights the importance of overcoming data silos and making data discoverable to improve data utilization and efficiency.

Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:
Better informed decision-making.
Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
Improved data analytics and reporting.
Higher performing systems.
More efficient operations.
Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.
Data Catalogs
Enterprise Search Engine: This is a challenging option with limitations. While it can find data locations, it might not uncover hidden confidential data or assess data quality (accuracy, completeness, etc.).

Enterprise Data Catalog: This is a more popular approach, like a product catalog in a store. It lists available data sets and provides valuable details about them, making it easier to locate and understand the data you need

3 ESSENTAIL BENEFITS OF DATA CATALOGS
Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.

Understanding data: Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.

Making data more useful: Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.

IMPORTANT
Done right, a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance.

BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OD A DATA CATALOG
image

A data catalog is essentially a directory of an organization's data holdings. It goes beyond just listing datasets; it also includes valuable details about the data itself, which is called metadata.
Metadata can be entered manually or automatically retrieved from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in automating metadata collection.
The presence of metadata makes a data catalog even more valuable because it allows users to understand the data better. This includes aspects like what the data represents, its format, quality, and how current it is.
3 TYPES OF METADATA IN DATA CATALOG
Technical metadata: Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
Business metadata: Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
Operational metadata: Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.
EXAMPLES OF METADATA

Associated systems.
File names.
File locations.
Data owners.
Data descriptions.
Dates created.
Dates last modified.
List of database tables and views.
Data stewards.
Size of data sets.
Quality score.
Comments.
For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.

With a data catalog, an organization can:
Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
Reduce data duplication.
Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
Understand data quality.
Manage compliance.
Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.
A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization. The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated. But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management.

The data catalog increased trust in data, leading to efficiency, profitability, and reduced risk.
Overall, the case study highlights how data governance, implemented through a data catalog, can empower businesses to collaborate, innovate, and achieve their goals while maintaining data compliance.

Data's Hidden Potential: Raw data itself isn't inherently valuable. It requires analysis to unlock its potential insights.
Data Analytics in Action: Data analytics uses specialized skills and software to examine data sets and extract valuable information for businesses.
Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis: Data analysis is a part of data analytics. It focuses on examining past data and reporting on the findings.
The Broader Scope of Data Analytics: Data analytics is a more comprehensive field. It covers the entire data lifecycle, from collection and cleaning to analysis and using it to predict future possibilities.
THE SOURCE OD DATA FOR ANALYTICS IS ONE OR A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING:

First-party data: Data that an organization collects.
Second-party data: Data that is obtained from another organization.
Third-party data: Aggregated data obtained from a provider.
TYPICAL USES OF CONTEMPORARY DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES INCLUDE: * Vastly improved decision-making * Focused marketing campaigns * Understanding the competitive landscape * Designing more innovative products * Better customer service * Improved operations * Insights on customer behavior

summary of the passage on the rise of data analytics:
Data Analytics on the Rise: Data analytics has become increasingly important for businesses in recent years.
Factors Contributing to Growth: This growth is driven by several factors:
Recognition of data's value by organizations.
The emergence of big data (massive datasets).
Data science becoming a sought-after skill.
Introduction of powerful new analytics tools.
The Role of AI: These new tools often leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find patterns and relationships in data faster and more accurately. AI can assist data analysts, improving their work's efficiency and precision.
IMPORTANT
Any organization that is serious about increasing the use of data for a wide range of business purposes must be ready to govern its data analytics capabilities. This includes policies and procedures, experienced talent, and a suite of contemporary software tools.

DATA MANETIATION

Data as an Intangible Asset: We learned in Chapter 3 that data is an intangible asset, similar to copyrights or software, not a physical asset like inventory.
Data on the Financial Statements: Unlike tangible assets, data isn't typically reflected on a company's balance sheet. Financial reporting focuses on assets that can be accurately valued.
Importance of Valuation: While not on the balance sheet, valuing assets (including data) helps understand their importance and role in the organization. It also serves financial purposes like accountability, tax calculations, and loan applications.
IMPORTANT
Intuitively, when something has a high value, it’s likely to be treated differently from things with little value.

The Challenge: Without a formal process to assign value to data (data valuation), different people in an organization might have subjective and varying opinions about its worth. This can lead to underestimating the potential of data for improving business growth and efficiency.
Data Monetization: This refers to the broader concept of using data to generate economic benefits for an organization. It essentially captures the goal of turning data into financial value, especially for for-profit businesses.
Valuation's Importance: While data valuation is generally recommended for larger companies, it's crucial for advanced forms of data monetization, such as selling or licensing data sets.
IMPORTANAT
Cost Value Method: This method is simple and estimates value based on the cost of creating, storing, and replacing data. However, it's subjective and doesn't consider the potential economic benefits the data might generate.

Market Value Approach: This method looks for similar data sets being sold in the market to determine a price. It's ideal if such comparisons exist, but for most unique data sets, this approach isn't applicable.

Economic Value Approach: This method tries to measure the financial impact of data on the business's bottom line. However, it's challenging to isolate the specific value of data from other contributing factors.

With-and-Without Method: This method compares cash flow scenarios with and without the data to estimate its value. While useful, it can be difficult to pinpoint the data's exact impact on cash flow.

IMPORTANAT
What’s clear from data valuation methods is that none of them are perfect. Above all, data valuation is very hard. But in practice don’t be discouraged. It’s hard for every type of organization. Fortunately, a number of providers are ready to help if you want outside assistance

Data as a Strategic Asset: When an organization recognizes data as a valuable asset, it needs a strategic approach to manage it.
Data Asset Management: This involves understanding what data the organization possesses, its value, and how to utilize it effectively.
Key Components:
Data inventory: Knowing what data sets exist.
Data valuation: Understanding the worth of each data set.
Utilization plan: Strategizing how to leverage data for benefit.
ROI measurement: Tracking the return on investment from data initiatives.
IMPORTANT For optimal data monetization, organizations must manage high-value data with the same priority and rigor (and maybe even more) that it treats its most important tangible assets.

DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING
Flawed Analysis: The Tsar, upon hearing more doctors were in Siberia where people were sick, ordered them killed. This exemplifies poor data analysis.

Data for Informed Decisions: The core value of data lies in making better decisions. It's applicable across all functions within a company, unlike some data uses specific to certain areas like marketing.

IMPORTANT Simply stated, data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions.

Basic DDDM is Commonplace: Most people already use data informally in daily decisions, at work and at home.
For High Performance: But for DDDM to truly benefit an organization, it requires more than just basic use.
Data Culture is Key: A supportive culture that values data-driven decision making is crucial. Leaders who use DDDM themselves become role models for others.
Enabling Data Use: Employees need access to data, tools, and training to make data-driven decisions effectively.
Data Governance: Data security and data use policies, managed through data governance, are essential for ensuring the right people have access to the right data at the right time.
In short, while basic DDDM is intuitive, building a strong data culture with proper data access and governance is vital for organizations to maximize the benefits of data-driven decision making.

6 STEP PROCESS TO DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING

Define Objectives:
Clearly define the goals you want to achieve with your data analysis. Ensure these goals align with the organization's overall objectives. Determine how you'll measure success (metrics) based on these goals. 2. Identify the Data:

Use available resources like data catalogs or search tools to find relevant data. Consult with stakeholders across different teams to get a broader perspective on the data needed. This might reveal the need to collect new data that isn't currently available. Collaborate with data owners and governance teams to ensure proper data access. 3. Prepare the Data:

Assess the quality and accessibility of the data based on your objectives. In most cases, data will likely require cleaning, transformation, or may be spread across different formats. Depending on the complexity, data science skills might be needed to prepare the data for analysis. 4. Analyze the Data:

Choose appropriate data analytics tools based on your needs. Complex analyses might require multiple tools or involve an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to move data between systems. Use data visualizations like graphs and charts to present the data effectively for your audience (e.g., dashboards for executives). 5. Determine the Findings:

Once the data is prepared and visualized, you can start asking questions and analyzing it to identify patterns or trends. This step requires critical thinking skills to ask the right questions that will lead to valuable insights. 6. Take Action:

Based on the analysis, make informed decisions and take necessary actions. If the analysis suggests no action is needed, that's still a valid outcome. The ultimate goal of DDDM is to use data to make better decisions that drive action

Iterative Process: While the six steps of DDDM provide a framework, the process is often iterative. You might revisit earlier steps as you analyze the data. For instance, you might discover missing data during analysis and need to go back to data identification (step 2).
Benefits of DDDM:
Improved decision-making: DDDM leads to better and faster decisions based on data analysis.
Empowered teams: Team members feel more confident and in control when using data to make decisions.
Enhanced collaboration: DDDM often fosters collaboration across different business units within an organization.
In conclusion, effectively implementing DDDM can significantly improve an organization's decision-making capabilities and bring several additional benefits.

DEVELOPING A DATA STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED RESULTS
Focus of the Course: This course emphasizes the proactive steps needed to unlock the value of data.
Common Problem: Many organizations take a passive approach to data management.
Reactive vs. Proactive: Organizations often react to situations instead of having a strategic plan for data.
Missed Opportunities: Data initiatives are seen as secondary to larger projects or as a response to immediate needs, potentially missing long-term strategic opportunities.
