EXAMINING THE BOARDER VALUE OF DATA
In small businesses, data is often manageable. There are few data systems, and team members know where most data resides, like customer information or invoices. This allows for easy data access by team members without needing specialists, which is called data democratization.

IMPORTANT
As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise. Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive.

THE CHALLENGES OF DATA SILOS AND THE IMPORTANACE OF DATA DISCOVERABILITY
Data Silos: Over time, data gets compartmentalized into isolated repositories called data silos. This happens due to various factors like culture, strategy, or mergers.
Impact of Silos: Data silos cause problems:

Reduced efficiency: Collaboration is hindered as different teams don't have access to each other's data.
Increased inconsistencies: Data inconsistencies arise when the same information is stored differently in silos.
Security and regulatory risks: Siloed data management makes it harder to secure data and comply with regulations.
Data Governance and Discovery: Data governance helps break down silos by making data discoverable and accessible throughout the organization. Data catalogs are a key tool for data governance in achieving this.

The Data Search Struggle: Unlike a web search engine, finding data within an organization is often difficult.
Finding relevant data can take up 70% of an analyst's time, leaving only 30% for actual analysis (according to an IBM survey).
Ironically, it can be easier to find information about your own company through a public search engine than through internal systems.
The passage highlights the importance of overcoming data silos and making data discoverable to improve data utilization and efficiency.

Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:
Better informed decision-making.
Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
Improved data analytics and reporting.
Higher performing systems.
More efficient operations.
Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.
Data Catalogs
Enterprise Search Engine: This is a challenging option with limitations. While it can find data locations, it might not uncover hidden confidential data or assess data quality (accuracy, completeness, etc.).

Enterprise Data Catalog: This is a more popular approach, like a product catalog in a store. It lists available data sets and provides valuable details about them, making it easier to locate and understand the data you need

3 ESSENTAIL BENEFITS OF DATA CATALOGS
Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.

Understanding data: Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.

Making data more useful: Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.

IMPORTANT
Done right, a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance.

BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OD A DATA CATALOG

A data catalog is essentially a directory of an organization's data holdings. It goes beyond just listing datasets; it also includes valuable details about the data itself, which is called metadata.
Metadata can be entered manually or automatically retrieved from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in automating metadata collection.
The presence of metadata makes a data catalog even more valuable because it allows users to understand the data better. This includes aspects like what the data represents, its format, quality, and how current it is.
3 TYPES OF METADATA IN DATA CATALOG
Technical metadata: Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
Business metadata: Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
Operational metadata: Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.
EXAMPLES OF METADATA

Associated systems.
File names.
File locations.
Data owners.
Data descriptions.
Dates created.
Dates last modified.
List of database tables and views.
Data stewards.
Size of data sets.
Quality score.
Comments.
For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.

With a data catalog, an organization can:
Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
Reduce data duplication.
Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
Understand data quality.
Manage compliance.
Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.
A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization. The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated. But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management.

Overall, the case study highlights how data governance, implemented through a data catalog, can empower businesses to collaborate, innovate, and achieve their goals while maintaining data compliance.

Data's Hidden Potential: Raw data itself isn't inherently valuable. It requires analysis to unlock its potential insights.
Data Analytics in Action: Data analytics uses specialized skills and software to examine data sets and extract valuable information for businesses.
Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis: Data analysis is a part of data analytics. It focuses on examining past data and reporting on the findings.
The Broader Scope of Data Analytics: Data analytics is a more comprehensive field. It covers the entire data lifecycle, from collection and cleaning to analysis and using it to predict future possibilities.
THE SOURCE OD DATA FOR ANALYTICS IS ONE OR A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING:

First-party data: Data that an organization collects.
Second-party data: Data that is obtained from another organization.
Third-party data: Aggregated data obtained from a provider.
TYPICAL USES OF CONTEMPORARY DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES INCLUDE: * Vastly improved decision-making * Focused marketing campaigns * Understanding the competitive landscape * Designing more innovative products * Better customer service * Improved operations * Insights on customer behavior

summary of the passage on the rise of data analytics:
Data Analytics on the Rise: Data analytics has become increasingly important for businesses in recent years.
Factors Contributing to Growth: This growth is driven by several factors:
Recognition of data's value by organizations.
The emergence of big data (massive datasets).
Data science becoming a sought-after skill.
Introduction of powerful new analytics tools.
The Role of AI: These new tools often leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find patterns and relationships in data faster and more accurately. AI can assist data analysts, improving their work's efficiency and precision.
IMPORTANT
Any organization that is serious about increasing the use of data for a wide range of business purposes must be ready to govern its data analytics capabilities. This includes policies and procedures, experienced talent, and a suite of contemporary software tools.

DATA MANETIATION

Data as an Intangible Asset: We learned in Chapter 3 that data is an intangible asset, similar to copyrights or software, not a physical asset like inventory.
Data on the Financial Statements: Unlike tangible assets, data isn't typically reflected on a company's balance sheet. Financial reporting focuses on assets that can be accurately valued.
Importance of Valuation: While not on the balance sheet, valuing assets (including data) helps understand their importance and role in the organization. It also serves financial purposes like accountability, tax calculations, and loan applications.
IMPORTANT
Intuitively, when something has a high value, it’s likely to be treated differently from things with little value.

The Challenge: Without a formal process to assign value to data (data valuation), different people in an organization might have subjective and varying opinions about its worth. This can lead to underestimating the potential of data for improving business growth and efficiency.
Data Monetization: This refers to the broader concept of using data to generate economic benefits for an organization. It essentially captures the goal of turning data into financial value, especially for for-profit businesses.
Valuation's Importance: While data valuation is generally recommended for larger companies, it's crucial for advanced forms of data monetization, such as selling or licensing data sets.
IMPORTANAT
Cost Value Method: This method is simple and estimates value based on the cost of creating, storing, and replacing data. However, it's subjective and doesn't consider the potential economic benefits the data might generate.

Market Value Approach: This method looks for similar data sets being sold in the market to determine a price. It's ideal if such comparisons exist, but for most unique data sets, this approach isn't applicable.

Economic Value Approach: This method tries to measure the financial impact of data on the business's bottom line. However, it's challenging to isolate the specific value of data from other contributing factors.

With-and-Without Method: This method compares cash flow scenarios with and without the data to estimate its value. While useful, it can be difficult to pinpoint the data's exact impact on cash flow.

IMPORTANAT
What’s clear from data valuation methods is that none of them are perfect. Above all, data valuation is very hard. But in practice don’t be discouraged. It’s hard for every type of organization. Fortunately, a number of providers are ready to help if you want outside assistance

Data as a Strategic Asset: When an organization recognizes data as a valuable asset, it needs a strategic approach to manage it.
Data Asset Management: This involves understanding what data the organization possesses, its value, and how to utilize it effectively.
Key Components:
Data inventory: Knowing what data sets exist.
Data valuation: Understanding the worth of each data set.
Utilization plan: Strategizing how to leverage data for benefit.
ROI measurement: Tracking the return on investment from data initiatives.
IMPORTANT For optimal data monetization, organizations must manage high-value data with the same priority and rigor (and maybe even more) that it treats its most important tangible assets.

DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING
Flawed Analysis: The Tsar, upon hearing more doctors were in Siberia where people were sick, ordered them killed. This exemplifies poor data analysis.

Data for Informed Decisions: The core value of data lies in making better decisions. It's applicable across all functions within a company, unlike some data uses specific to certain areas like marketing.

IMPORTANT Simply stated, data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions.

Basic DDDM is Commonplace: Most people already use data informally in daily decisions, at work and at home.
For High Performance: But for DDDM to truly benefit an organization, it requires more than just basic use.
Data Culture is Key: A supportive culture that values data-driven decision making is crucial. Leaders who use DDDM themselves become role models for others.
Enabling Data Use: Employees need access to data, tools, and training to make data-driven decisions effectively.
Data Governance: Data security and data use policies, managed through data governance, are essential for ensuring the right people have access to the right data at the right time.
In short, while basic DDDM is intuitive, building a strong data culture with proper data access and governance is vital for organizations to maximize the benefits of data-driven decision making.

6 STEP PROCESS TO DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING

Define Objectives:
Clearly define the goals you want to achieve with your data analysis. Ensure these goals align with the organization's overall objectives. Determine how you'll measure success (metrics) based on these goals. 2. Identify the Data:

Use available resources like data catalogs or search tools to find relevant data. Consult with stakeholders across different teams to get a broader perspective on the data needed. This might reveal the need to collect new data that isn't currently available. Collaborate with data owners and governance teams to ensure proper data access. 3. Prepare the Data:

Assess the quality and accessibility of the data based on your objectives. In most cases, data will likely require cleaning, transformation, or may be spread across different formats. Depending on the complexity, data science skills might be needed to prepare the data for analysis. 4. Analyze the Data:

Choose appropriate data analytics tools based on your needs. Complex analyses might require multiple tools or involve an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to move data between systems. Use data visualizations like graphs and charts to present the data effectively for your audience (e.g., dashboards for executives). 5. Determine the Findings:

Once the data is prepared and visualized, you can start asking questions and analyzing it to identify patterns or trends. This step requires critical thinking skills to ask the right questions that will lead to valuable insights. 6. Take Action:

Based on the analysis, make informed decisions and take necessary actions. If the analysis suggests no action is needed, that's still a valid outcome. The ultimate goal of DDDM is to use data to make better decisions that drive action

Iterative Process: While the six steps of DDDM provide a framework, the process is often iterative. You might revisit earlier steps as you analyze the data. For instance, you might discover missing data during analysis and need to go back to data identification (step 2).
Benefits of DDDM:
Improved decision-making: DDDM leads to better and faster decisions based on data analysis.
Empowered teams: Team members feel more confident and in control when using data to make decisions.
Enhanced collaboration: DDDM often fosters collaboration across different business units within an organization.
In conclusion, effectively implementing DDDM can significantly improve an organization's decision-making capabilities and bring several additional benefits.

DEVELOPING A DATA STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED RESULTS
Focus of the Course: This course emphasizes the proactive steps needed to unlock the value of data.
Common Problem: Many organizations take a passive approach to data management.
Reactive vs. Proactive: Organizations often react to situations instead of having a strategic plan for data.
Missed Opportunities: Data initiatives are seen as secondary to larger projects or as a response to immediate needs, potentially missing long-term strategic opportunities.
